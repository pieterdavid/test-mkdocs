# Welcome to this MkDocs test website

A simple attempt to have a documentation "wiki" with git for version control,
to collect the documentation for the cp3-llbb Framework and CRAB3-related tools.

If deployment can be done automatically (with travis to gitlab pages),
updating the documentation site is simply a matter of comitting changes
to the markdown source on github/gitlab.
Bonus points: every merge/push in Framework triggers a rebuild of the doxygen?
